Point of Sale (POS) system tailored specifically for optical stores. Here are some key features:

1. Patient Data Management: Optical shops deal with a vast amount of patient data. Each customer has a unique prescription (RX), insurance details, and specific insurance codes. A robust POS system streamlines the management of this data, ensuring accurate records and personalized service.

2. Inventory Control: Eyewear stores carry a diverse range of frames, lenses, and accessories. An effective POS system tracks inventory levels, alerts for restocking, and manages stock variations based on different prescriptions and styles.

3. RX Database: The system maintains an extensive RX database, making it easy to retrieve and process prescriptions during sales or appointments. This ensures accuracy and minimizes errors.

4. Direct Supplier Integration: Optical POS systems allow direct posting to suppliers and vendors. Whether ordering new stock or handling returns, seamless communication with suppliers improves efficiency.
